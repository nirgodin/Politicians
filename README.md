# Twitter in Time of Election
In the last decade, politicians shifted a vast majority of their election campaigns resources to the social media. 
Journalists, although still dedicating most of theire efforts to  the traditional media channels, haven't stagnated and shifted much of theire activity to the social media as well.
In lights of these development and the exponential evolvement of the Natural Language Processing theory and tools, it is very interesting to analyze the way politicians and journalists behave and express themselves in the social media.
To this end, this project scrapes tweets of ### politicians ### journalists ### parties #### media channels during the Israeli 4th consecutive election, conducted from December 20' to March 21'.
