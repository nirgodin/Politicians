# Twitter in time of election
In this project I've scraped tweets of 101 politicians, 159 journalists, 10 political parties and 21 media channels twitter accounts during the Israeli 4th consecutive election, conducted from December 20' to March 21'.
The project consists of two parts: current and upcoming. The current part uses this data to analyse in real time what's on the agenda of the political players and the media, as well as some more general analysis that will be shown soon. The upcoming part will use the data for building machine learning NLP models.

# The motivation
The motivation behind this project is quite clear. In the last decade, politicians shifted vast majority of their election campaigns and resources to the social media. 
Journalists, although still dedicating most of their efforts to the traditional media channels, haven't stagnated and shifted much of theire activity to the social media as well.
In lights of these development and the exponential evolvement of the Natural Language Processing theory and tools, it is very interesting to analyze the way politicians and journalists behave and express themselves in the social media.

# Wordclouds
A clear, usefull and colourfull way to describe what's on the agenda is a wordcloud, which displays the words that were most commonly used during a given period of time. Each word's size indicates the number of times it was used relative to the other words. This cloud, for example, is representing the agenda on the third week of the election, from 01-01-2021 to 08-01-2021.
